# Gigasecond

Write a program that will calculate the date that someone turned or will celebrate their 1 Gs anniversary.

A gigasecond is one billion (10**9) seconds.

To run the tests simply run the command `go test` in the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `-bench`
flag:

    go test -bench .
