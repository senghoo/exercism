# Bracket Push

Make sure the brackets and braces all match.

Ensure that all the brackets and braces are matched correctly,
and nested correctly.

To run the tests simply run the command `go test` in the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `-bench`
flag:

    go test -bench .

For more detailed info about the Go track see the [help
